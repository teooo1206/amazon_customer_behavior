### Summary of the Project: Predicting Customer Behavior Using Machine Learning Models

This project focuses on predicting customer behavior, specifically subscription rates, using various machine learning models. The goal is to optimize marketing strategies by identifying the most profitable customer segments and improving the return on investment (ROI) for marketing campaigns. The project is divided into four main sections: Break-Even Response Rate & ROI, Unsupervised Learning for Segmentation and Targeting, Decision Tree Analysis, and Random Forest.

#### 1. **Break-Even Response Rate & ROI**
   - **Objective**: Calculate the break-even response rate and ROI for a blanket marketing campaign targeting 10,000 customers.
   - **Key Calculations**:
     - **Profit per Customer**: Calculated as `profit_per_customer = avg_revenue * (1 - COGS) + amazon_prime_fee - shipping`.
     - **Break-Even Response Rate**: Determined as `breakeven_response_rate = cost_per_offer / profit_per_customer`.
     - **ROI for Blanket Campaign**: Calculated based on the total costs of mailing and the total profit from subscribers.
   - **Results**:
     - The break-even response rate was found to be **10.01%**.
     - The ROI for the blanket campaign was **-16.26%**, indicating a loss.
   - **Skills Gained**:
     - Understanding of break-even analysis.
     - Calculation of ROI for marketing campaigns.
     - Basic financial modeling in R.

#### 2. **Unsupervised Learning for Segmentation and Targeting**
   - **Objective**: Use unsupervised learning (K-means clustering) to segment customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value (RFM) metrics.
   - **Key Steps**:
     - **RFM Analysis**: Created RFM variables (`recency`, `frequency`, `monetary_value`) to segment customers.
     - **K-means Clustering**: Applied K-means clustering to identify optimal customer segments.
     - **Silhouette Method**: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters (2 clusters were identified).
   - **Results**:
     - Cluster 1 had a lower subscription rate (**6.8%**), while Cluster 2 had a higher subscription rate (**12.6%**).
     - The ROI for targeting Cluster 2 was **25.6%**, while targeting Cluster 1 resulted in a negative ROI (**-32.03%**).
   - **Skills Gained**:
     - RFM analysis for customer segmentation.
     - K-means clustering and the use of the Silhouette method.
     - Interpretation of clustering results for targeted marketing.

#### 3. **Decision Tree Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Build a decision tree model to predict customer subscription behavior based on RFM variables.
   - **Key Steps**:
     - **Data Preparation**: Split the data into training and test sets.
     - **Model Training**: Trained a decision tree model using the `rpart` package.
     - **Prediction**: Used the model to predict subscription probabilities and identified target customers based on the break-even response rate.
   - **Results**:
     - The ROI for the decision tree model was **71.86%**, significantly higher than the blanket campaign and K-means clustering.
   - **Skills Gained**:
     - Building and interpreting decision tree models.
     - Using decision trees for customer targeting.
     - Evaluating model performance using ROI.

#### 4. **Random Forest**
   - **Objective**: Improve prediction accuracy using a Random Forest model.
   - **Key Steps**:
     - **Model Training**: Trained a Random Forest model using the `ranger` package with 5,000 trees.
     - **Prediction**: Predicted subscription probabilities and identified target customers based on the break-even response rate.
   - **Results**:
     - The ROI for the Random Forest model was **42.96%**, which is lower than the decision tree but still better than the blanket campaign and K-means clustering.
   - **Skills Gained**:
     - Building and interpreting Random Forest models.
     - Understanding the trade-offs between model complexity and performance.
     - Applying ensemble methods for customer behavior prediction.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Machine Learning Models**: The project demonstrates the application of various machine learning models (K-means clustering, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict customer behavior and optimize marketing strategies.
- **ROI Optimization**: By using targeted marketing strategies based on machine learning models, the ROI was significantly improved compared to a blanket marketing approach.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: The project highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in marketing, using customer segmentation and predictive modeling to identify the most profitable customer segments.

### Skills Acquired:
- **Data Analysis**: RFM analysis, customer segmentation, and break-even analysis.
- **Machine Learning**: K-means clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and model evaluation.
- **Programming**: Proficiency in R for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.
- **Business Acumen**: Understanding of ROI, customer lifetime value, and targeted marketing strategies.

This project provides a comprehensive understanding of how machine learning can be applied to real-world business problems, particularly in optimizing marketing campaigns and improving ROI.
